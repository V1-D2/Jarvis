# Jarvis
My voice assistant. This version of Jarvis helps in searching the Internet, YouTube and Wikipedia. Helps to order some food, say the weather in a user`s location or at any another one, can translate users requests. It voices the missed messages, convert the users words to the text and send to a chosen person. It also, tell jokes, remind which pills person should eat, moreover, before and after the eating it reminds which pill a person should take. It also says time, pick up clothes depending on weather and user`s activity. Finally, it reminds interesting and important user`s ideas, thougths or news, read the list of products needed in the shop. I also have improved the users` request and command recognizing and cleaning functions. Very soon I will add controlling of the smart system functions. They are not available now as the computer with them placed in another city and its owner cannot send me them.
