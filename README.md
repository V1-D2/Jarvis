# Jarvis
My voice assistant. This version of Jarvis helps in searching the Internet, YouTube and Wikipedia. Helps to order some food, say the weather in a user`s location or at any another one, can translate user`s requeats. It voices the missed messages, convert the user`s words to the text and send to a choosed person. It also, tell jokes, remind which pills person should eat, moreover, before and after the eating it reminds which pill a person should take. It also says time and have improved cleaning the user`s request system. Very soon I will add choosing the dress and controling the light functions. They are not aviable now as the computer with them placed in another city and it`s owner cannot send me them.
